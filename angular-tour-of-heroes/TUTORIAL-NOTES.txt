To create new angular project go to the desired directory (create in github, copy down to your IDE, type this in terminal)
	ng new "TITLE OF PROJECT"

Create new component
	ng generate component "COMPONENT NAME"
		Note: always export the class so can import it elsewhere (like the AppModule)
Spin it up on local4200 server
	ng serve --open

OnInit in components shouldn't have complex constructors. They should do no more than set the initial local variables to simple values.

Compile page
	npm start

Pipes:
	The pipe operator |
	After the pipe operator, you can activate built-in pip formats for displaying and you can even create your own!

MetaData
	Angular needs to know how pieces of App fit together and what other files and libarires the app requires. Such info is called MetaData
	You can opt into various modules in the app.module.ts
